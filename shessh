//chapter 1
when a debugger or any reversing tool is started something always changes but people do not understand what even chnages or what it does etc sorry for my grammar alright so usually
when we check for debugger we will check a windows structure that is called PEB:Process Enviroment Block this contains many values the one we will be checking is NtGlobalFlag usually 
this  is an offset with a value 0xbc you can check out win structs on this website https://www.vergiliusproject.com/ <- useful  nvm too lazy im just gonna write it.







ima create a class cause im lame like that 


typedef NTSTATUS (NTAPI *TNtQueryInformationProcess)(
    IN HANDLE           ProcessHandle,
    IN PROCESSINFOCLASS ProcessInformationClass,
    OUT PVOID           ProcessInformation,
    IN ULONG            ProcessInformationLength,
    OUT PULONG          ReturnLength
    );






//if there is error im sorry im codng this on a a file on github lol


bool BdebuggerPresent;
class Nodebug {

void PrsentD() {
if (IsDebuggerPresent())
    ExitProcess(0);
    
}

void remotedebug() {
if (true == CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent(GetCurrentProcess(), &BdebuggerPresent) &&
    true == BdebuggerPresent)
    ExitProcess(0);
}

//hmm fuck this ima do this at home lol

}
